# CSFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for C

SFML is a simple, fast, cross-platform and object-oriented multimedia API. It provides access to windowing, graphics, audio and network. It is originally written in C++, and this project is its official binding for the C language.

## State of Development

Development is focused on the next major version in the `master` branch. No more features are planned for the 2.x release series.

-   The [`master`](https://github.com/SFML/CSFML/tree/master) branch contains work in progress for the next major version CSFML 3. As such it's considered unstable, but any testing and feedback is highly appreciated.
-   The [`2.6.1`](https://github.com/SFML/CSFML/tree/2.6.1) tag is the latest official SFML release and will be the last minor release in the 2.x series.
-   The [`2.6.x`](https://github.com/SFML/CSFML/tree/2.6.x) branch contains the latest bugfix work on CSFML 2.6.x, matching SFML's `2.6.x` branch.
